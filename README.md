Introduction:
Heart disease is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease are crucial for effective prevention and treatment strategies. In this project, we aim to design and implement a heart disease prediction system using various classification algorithms. By analyzing different algorithms' performance over the dataset, we seek to identify the most effective model for predicting heart disease.
Abstract 
This project aims to predict heart disease using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbours. The dataset consists of patient attributes like age, sex, and medical measurements. After training and testing each model, their accuracies are compared to determine the best performer. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into which classification algorithm is most effective for heart disease prediction.
Project Overview:
This project aims to predict heart disease risk using various classification algorithms on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. After testing multiple models, including Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy. We converted this model to a pickle file and developed a GUI application using Tkinter. The GUI accepts user inputs for various health metrics and predicts the risk of heart disease accordingly, providing a convenient and accessible tool for health assessment.

IMPEMENTATION:
To implement heart disease prediction using different classification algorithms and analyze the best one over the dataset, follow these steps:
1.	Data Preparation:
•	Obtain the heart disease dataset from Kaggle or another reliable source.
•	Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
2.	Model Training:
•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
•	Train multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors using the training data.
3.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate each model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.
•	Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's predictive capabilities further.
4.	Selecting the Best Model:
•	Compare the performance of all models and identify the one with the highest accuracy or the most suitable metric for your application.
•	Save the best-performing model using pickle serialization for future use.
5.	GUI Development:
•	Use Tkinter or another GUI library to create a user-friendly interface.
•	Design the interface to accept user input for various health metrics such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc.
•	Implement the functionality to load the saved model and make predictions based on user inputs.
